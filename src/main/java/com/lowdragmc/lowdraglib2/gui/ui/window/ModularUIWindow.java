/**
 * Hosts any {@link ModularUI} in its own operating-system window.
 *
 * <p>This is the general-purpose entry point — nothing here knows about the editor. Give it a UI and
 * a title, call {@link #open}, and the UI is drawn into a second window that can be moved to another
 * monitor:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * var window = new ModularUIWindow(new ModularUI(UI.of(myRoot)), "My Tool");
 * window.setDragArea(myTitleBar);        // optional: what moves the window
 * window.setStyleSource(parentUI);       // optional: keep the parent's theme
 * if (!window.open(Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE, 640, 400, false)) {
 *     // no second window available - host myRoot in-game instead
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The UI is drawn into an off-screen target using Minecraft's own context and the ordinary render
 * path — same shaders, same fonts, same nested framebuffers — and then blitted into the second
 * window. Nothing about how the UI draws itself changes; only where it lands.
 *
 * <p>Input arrives as raw GLFW callbacks queued by {@link OsWindow} and is replayed here through the
 * same {@code ModularUIWidget} methods a {@code Screen} would call, so focus tracking, click counting
 * and drag bookkeeping all behave exactly as they do in the game window. Two overrides are installed
 * for the duration: {@link KeyState} reads <em>this</em> window's keyboard (GLFW key state is
 * per-window, so the game window's would report nothing while this one is focused), and
 * {@link ModularUI#active()} points here so anything that opens a popup without an element in hand
 * parents it into this UI rather than the parent's.
 *
 * <p>Windows are opened undecorated, so moving and resizing are handled here rather than by the
 * platform. That is not only cosmetic: a decorated window's move and resize gestures run in a nested
 * modal event loop inside {@code glfwPollEvents}, which Minecraft calls every frame, so dragging one
 * would freeze the entire game for as long as the mouse is held.
