/**
 * A Unity-style transform gizmo (move / rotate / scale) rendered on top of the scene.
 * <p>
 * The gizmo has no transform of its own that matters for rendering: it is drawn and picked entirely from
 * {@link #gizmoMatrix()} = {@code translate(targetPos) * rotate(orientation) * scale(screenConstant)}, so it
 * always sits on the target, faces the chosen {@link Space}, and keeps a constant on-screen size. Dragging is
 * resolved geometrically against the mouse ray (closest-point-on-axis for translate/scale, ray-vs-plane angle
 * for rotate) so the handle tracks the cursor exactly and rotation is independent of camera distance.
 *
 * <h2>Rotating</h2>
 * {@link Mode#ROTATE} follows Unreal's widget and offers four handles, in this pick order:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the three coloured {@linkplain Handle#AXIS_X axis rings}, which constrain the turn to one axis.
 *       Only the half of each on the near side of the ball is drawn — and only that half can be grabbed —
 *       so they read as three separate arcs on a sphere rather than three circles crossing each other
 *       twice, which is how you tell at a glance which one turns which way;</li>
 *   <li>the outer {@linkplain Handle#SCREEN screen ring}, which turns the target in the plane of the screen —
 *       about the eye-to-gizmo direction, frozen when the drag starts;</li>
 *   <li>the {@linkplain Handle#TRACKBALL ball} filling the rest of the gizmo, where a drag rolls the target
 *       freely with the grabbed point following the cursor.</li>
 * </ul>
 * A faint circle marks the ball's silhouette, which is the line the three arcs end on.
 * <p>
 * The rings are drawn as tubes rather than lines and picked analytically against an explicit tolerance that is
 * wider than they are drawn, because a line three pixels across is not something anyone can aim at.
 *
 * <h2>Moving</h2>
 * {@link Mode#TRANSLATE} has the three arrows, three {@linkplain Handle#PLANE_X squares} that slide the
 * target in one of the axis planes, and a {@linkplain Handle#FREE centre box} that slides it in the plane of
 * the screen. All four kinds of slide are the same operation — keep the point that was grabbed under the
 * cursor, on a plane fixed at the grab — differing only in which plane that is.
 *
 * <h2>Scaling</h2>
 * {@link Mode#SCALE} mirrors it: three axis boxes, three squares that scale the two axes they span, and a
 * {@linkplain Handle#UNIFORM centre box} that drives all three at once. The squares and the centre multiply
 * where an axis handle adds, so a target that was not square keeps the shape it was. What each is measured
 * along is the line it belongs to: a square's own diagonal, and for the centre — which has no axis at all —
 * the screen's diagonal, where dragging up and right grows and back down and left shrinks.
 *
 * <p>The squares sit well out along their axes rather than hugging the origin, so that aiming at one is not
 * a contest between it, the centre box and two arrows within the same few pixels.
